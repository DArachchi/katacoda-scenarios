Now that you've logged into OpenShift, let's deploy our new micro-trader Vert.x microservice:

**1. Create a ConfigMap**

A config map is a Kubernetes entity storing the configuration of an application. The application configuration is in src/kubernetes/config.json. We are going to create a config map from this file. In a terminal, execute:

``oc create configmap app-config --from-file=src/kubernetes/config.json``{{execute}}

To check that the config map has been created correctly, execute:

``oc get configmap -o yaml``{{execute}}

It should display the Kubernetes entity and in the data entry our json content.

Now that the config map is created, letâ€™s read it from our application. There are several ways to consume a config map:

* ENV variables
* Config mounted as a file
* Vert.x Config

We are going to use the second approach and mount the configuration as a file in the application container. Indeed, our application has been configured to read its configuration from a config/config.json file:

```java
private ConfigRetrieverOptions getConfigurationOptions() {
    JsonObject path = new JsonObject().put("path", "config/config.json");
    return new ConfigRetrieverOptions().addStore(new ConfigStoreOptions().setType("file").setConfig(path));
}
```

Our deployment.yaml located in src/main/fabric8 contains the right configuration to:

define a volume with the config map content

mount this volume in the right directory

You can also see that this file contains the JAVA options we pass to the process.


**2. Start the quote generator**

Red Hat OpenShift Application Runtimes includes a powerful maven plugin that can take an
existing Eclipse Vert.x application and generate the necessary Kubernetes configuration.

We have defined additional config, like ``quote-generator/src/main/fabric8/configmap.yml``{{open}} and ``quote-generator/src/main/fabric8/deployment.yml``{{open}} which defines
the deployment characteristics of the app (in this case we mount a config file from a ConfigMap), but OpenShift supports a wide range of [Deployment configuration options](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/deployments.html) for apps).

Build and deploy the project using the following command, which will use the maven plugin to deploy:

`mvn fabric8:deploy`{{execute}}

The build and deploy may take a minute or two. Wait for it to complete. You should see a **BUILD SUCCESS** at the
end of the build output.

After the maven build finishes it will take less than a minute for the application to become available.
To verify that everything is started, run the following command and wait for it complete successfully:

`oc rollout status -w dc/quote-generator`{{execute}}

**2. Access the application running on OpenShift**

 Click on the
[route URL](http://quote-generator-vertx-micro-trader.[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-80-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com)
to access the sample UI.

> You can also access the application through the link on the OpenShift Web Console Overview page.

**3. Build and Deploy the dashboard**

`cd /root/code/trader-dashboard`{{execute}}

`mvn fabric8:deploy`{{execute}}

Click on the
[route URL](http://trader-dashboard-vertx-micro-trader.[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-80-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com)
to access the sample UI.

## Congratulations!

You have deployed the quote-generator as a microservice. In the next component, we are going to implement an event bus service.
