Now that you've logged into OpenShift, let's deploy our new micro-trader Vert.x microservice:

**1. Create a ConfigMap**

A config map is a Kubernetes entity storing the configuration of an application. The application configuration is in src/kubernetes/config.json. We are going to create a config map from this file. In a terminal, execute:

``cd /root/code/quote-generator``{{execute}}

``oc create configmap app-config --from-file=src/kubernetes/config.json``{{execute}}

To check that the config map has been created correctly, execute:

``oc get configmap -o yaml``{{execute}}

It should display the Kubernetes entity and in the data entry our json content.

Now that the config map is created, letâ€™s read it from our application. There are several ways to consume a config map:

* ENV variables
* Config mounted as a file
* Vert.x Config

We are going to use the second approach and mount the configuration as a file in the application container. Indeed, our application has been configured to read its configuration from a src/kubernetes/config.json file:

```java
private ConfigRetrieverOptions getConfigurationOptions() {
    JsonObject path = new JsonObject().put("path", "src/kubernetes/config.json");
    return new ConfigRetrieverOptions().addStore(new ConfigStoreOptions().setType("file").setConfig(path));
}
```

For that, we have defined additional config in ``quote-generator/src/main/fabric8/deployment.yml``{{open} that contains the right configuration to:
1. define a volume with the config map content
2. mount this volume in the right directory

You can also see that this file contains the JAVA options we pass to the process.

**2. Start the quote generator**

Red Hat OpenShift Application Runtimes includes a powerful maven plugin that can take an
existing Eclipse Vert.x application and generate the necessary Kubernetes configuration.

Build and deploy the project using the following command, which will use the maven plugin to deploy:

`mvn fabric8:deploy -Popenshift`{{execute}}

The build and deploy may take a minute or two. Wait for it to complete. You should see a **BUILD SUCCESS** at the
end of the build output.

After the maven build finishes it will take less than a minute for the application to become available.
To verify that everything is started, run the following command and wait for it complete successfully:

`oc rollout status -w dc/quote-generator`{{execute}}

**2. Access the application running on OpenShift**

 Click on the
[route URL](http://quote-generator-vertx-micro-trader.[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-80-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com)
to access the sample UI.

> You can also access the application through the link on the OpenShift Web Console Overview page.

**3. Build and Deploy the dashboard**

`cd /root/code/micro-trader-dashboard`{{execute}}

`mvn fabric8:deploy -Popenshift`{{execute}}

Click on the
[route URL](http://trader-dashboard-vertx-micro-trader.[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-80-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/admin)
to access the sample UI.

## Congratulations!

You have deployed the quote-generator as a microservice. In the next component, we are going to implement an event bus service.
