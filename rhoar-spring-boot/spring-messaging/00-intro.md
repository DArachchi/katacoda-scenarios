In this scenario you will learn more about developing Spring Boot applications using the [Red Hat OpenShift Application Runtimes](https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhoar) platform. We will be building a simple Spring Boot application which produces messages to and consumes messages from a [JBOSS AMQ](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/amq) resource. Message driven apps are useful for producing loosely coupled, event driven applications. A primary benefit of this architecture is horizontal scalability and resilience to failure.
