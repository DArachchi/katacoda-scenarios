This scenario focuses on creating integration tests using [Arquillian Cube](http://arquillian.org/arquillian-cube/), both locally and using OpenShift.

In this scenario you will create a working integration test using Arquillian Cube. The integration test will test a simple web service. You will walk through the following steps:

1. Configure a sample project to use Arquillian Cube
2. Configure Arquillian Cube to run the test locally
3. Running the test locally, which will fail
4. Updating the test
5. Running the test locally, which will now pass
6. Run the test in OpenShift
