# Deploy to OpenShift Application Platform with Fabric8

Now that we have our application set up, let's try to deploy our application using Fabric8.

**1. Deploy our Application**

We're going to be using the OpenShift Container Application Platform that Katacoda sets up for us automatically, saving us the time of having to set up an OpenShift instance ourselves. There's a Spring application generated from the RHOAR Launcher already set up for us locally for OpenShift to access. We can verify this by executing a ``tree``{{execute}} command. The layout should perfectly match our previous application.

Since we have our application set up locally, the next step is to log in to the OpenShift platform so we can deploy it there. To do that we will use the `oc` command and then specify a username and password like this:

``oc login [[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8443-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com --insecure-skip-tls-verify=true -u developer -p developer``{{execute}}

Next we create a project to house our application:

``oc new-project dev --display-name="Dev - Spring Boot App"``{{execute}}

All that's left is to run the following command to deploy the application to OpenShift:

``mvn package fabric8:deploy -Popenshift``{{execute}}

If any of this seems confusing, make sure to check previous trainings where we cover this process in more detail.

## Congratulations

You have now learned how to deploy a Spring Boot application generated by either the Spring Initializr tool or the RHOAR Launcher tool to the OpenShift Container Platform with Fabric8.
