In this scenario you will get started developing Spring Boot applications using the [Red Hat OpenShift Application Runtimes](https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhoar) platform. We will be downloading a simple Spring Boot application with the Spring Initializr and then taking a look at all the steps required to get this base application deployment ready. After that, we'll be taking a look at a project that we've set up using the RHOAR Launcher, a tool that helps us skip some of the additional steps and provides a ready-to-use project right out of the box!
